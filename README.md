# Steam API and Web Scraping

### Project Objective
The aim of this project is to understand the factors that affect the success of video games available on the Steam platform. The Steam platform is one of the most popular services for the distribution of digital video games, which is why it is a highly competitive and dynamic market for video game companies that aim to profit of their products. Understanding what makes a game successful is important for game developers, so the project seeks to identify the common factors that lead to the success of top-selling games in various genres on Steam. I am mainly focusing on the positive and negative reviews each game has.

### Rockstar games
Rockstar Games is a renowned video game developer and publisher that has gained a reputation for producing some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful titles in the industry. Their games are known for their innovative gameplay mechanics, immersive open-world environments, and gripping storylines. Rockstar Games has also been at the forefront of incorporating new technologies into their games, such as motion capture and facial recognition, to enhance the realism of their characters and settings. Overall, Rockstar Games is a leading figure in the gaming industry, with a loyal fan base and a legacy of groundbreaking titles that have left a lasting impact on the medium. The project's findings on the factors that affect the success of video games on the Steam platform could be extremely valuable to Rockstar Games. As a major player in the video game industry, Rockstar Games is always looking for ways to improve their products and gain an edge over their competitors. By analyzing the data collected from this project, Rockstar Games could gain insight into what makes a game successful on Steam and adjust their development strategy accordingly. Negative/positive reviews, the top games of each genres and also various video game prices, can all be extremely useful for Rockstar games if they want to improve their current game titles or expand their games library in the future.

### Data
I have retrieved the data from Steam's top selling website and also their API. I webscraped their top selling website with 5 video game categories as its perimeters which are: action, adventure, role-playing, sports and race. I then created 2 dictionaries for each genre which keeps info about games details and reviews. I ended up with 10 tables which I had inserted into my Amazon AWS database.

### Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would clean up the data a little bit more. There were a lot of null values within Steam's top selling website, so in the future I would try and web scrape Steam's category library instead of using the top selling website for more accurate results. I would also like to compare Steam's  prices and reviews with other gaming distribution platforms, such ash Nintendo, Battle.net etc.
